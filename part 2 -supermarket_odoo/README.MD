# Part 2 ODOO models

## In this part I've created models as the instruction says:


* Cart
* CartItem
* Customer
* Product
* ProductCategory

## I've created ER Diagram to illustrate the relations between the models

## The computed fields are:
 * cart_item_total - compute the quantity x unit price
 * cart_premium - checks if the customer visited more than 1 time since last week
